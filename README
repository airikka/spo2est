spo2est - SpO2 Edit Start Time

A Python script that creates a new SpO2 file from an existing SpO2 file with edited start time.
The new file is placed in the same directory as the old one, with "_mod" added to its name.
Only tested with a SpO2 file from a CMS50D+ device.

Usage:
./spo2est year month day hour minute second input-file.SpO2
Note: Input file must end with ".SpO2"

E.g:
./spo2est 2016 7 12 23 12 11 /path/to/filename.SpO2
